# The Constitution of X1

### 1. Freedom of Individual Agency 🕊️

All individuals have the right to communicate, transact, and interact freely in a decentralized, permissionless manner without interference and censorship from centralized authorities.

### 2. Self-Custody and Ownership 🔐

Every participant retains full control over their digital assets, data, and private information. No entity can seize or alter an individual’s property without their explicit consent.

### 3. Privacy as a Choice 🕶️

Participants have the option to protect their personal information, activities, and financial interactions. This is achieved through encryption and other cryptographic methods, allowing individuals to maintain control over how much of their identity is revealed.

### 4. Transparency and Accountability via Code 💻

X1 advocates for open-source, verifiable smart contracts and cryptographic protocols where trust is embedded in technology rather than fallible human intermediaries.

### 5. Evolution Through Innovation 🚀

X1 is committed to the continuous evolution of cryptographic methods, decentralized technology, and blockchain innovations, adapting to new challenges and fostering a future where freedom, privacy, and decentralization thrive.
