# Technical Roadmap

X1 Blockchain is designed for **high performance, scalability, and security**. From launch, it will feature:

- âœ… **[Zero-Cost Votes](../zero-cost-votes.md)** â€“ Optimize consensus efficiency with no-cost validator votes.
- âœ… **[Congestion-Reflective Dynamic Base Fees](../dynamic-base-fees.md)** â€“ Adaptive fees that respond to network load, preventing congestion.

Beyond these core features, X1 will introduce **next-level scaling and performance upgrades**, including:

## Upcoming Enhancements

### **[SVM Capacity Scaling](svm-capacity-scaling.md)**  
Increase the Solana Virtual Machineâ€™s (SVM) capacity, enabling **higher throughput** and **more efficient execution**.

### **[Homomorphic Encryption](homomorphic-encryption.md)**  
Implement encrypted transaction processing for **privacy-preserving computations** without decrypting sensitive data.

### **[Performance-Based Leader Selection](performance-based-leader-selection.md)**  
Optimize leader selection in consensus, ensuring **only the most efficient validators** process transactions.

### **[Scaling Through Reductionism](scaling-through-reductionism.md)**  
Streamline blockchain operations by reducing complexity, leading to **faster validation** and **improved decentralization**.
