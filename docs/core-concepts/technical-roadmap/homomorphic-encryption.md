# Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic breakthrough that allows computations on **encrypted data** without decrypting it. The result, once decrypted, is identical to performing the same operations on the original, unencrypted data.

This enables secure data processing while preserving confidentiality, making it a powerful tool for privacy-focused applications.

## Why is Homomorphic Encryption Important?

Traditional encryption protects data at rest and in transit but exposes it when computations are needed. Homomorphic encryption solves this by keeping data encrypted **throughout processing**, ensuring:

- **Privacy Preservation** ‚Äì Sensitive data remains encrypted, even during computation, making it ideal for cloud computing and outsourced processing.
- **Enhanced Security** ‚Äì Eliminates risks from breaches and insider threats by never exposing raw data.
- **Regulatory Compliance** ‚Äì Helps organizations meet strict data privacy laws in industries like finance and healthcare.
- **Data Utility** ‚Äì Enables meaningful analysis and transactions on encrypted data, even in shared environments.

With **linear bandwidth scaling** and **millisecond-level decryption speeds**, homomorphic encryption is efficient, secure, and ready for real-world applications.

## Use Cases

Homomorphic encryption unlocks **secure, programmable computation** for blockchain and decentralized applications:

- ‚úÖ **Encrypted On-Chain Intents** ‚Äì Secure limit orders, stop-loss orders, and programmable trading.
- ‚úÖ **Bad-MEV Prevention** ‚Äì Protect transactions from front-running and malicious behavior.
- ‚úÖ **Private Governance** ‚Äì Enable secure, encrypted voting for DAOs and governance proposals.
- ‚úÖ **Censorship-Resistant Sequencing** ‚Äì Prevent manipulation and selective transaction filtering.
- ‚úÖ **On-Chain Gaming** ‚Äì Secure game logic and randomness without revealing sensitive information.
- ‚úÖ **Legal Contracts & Oracles** ‚Äì Preserve privacy in contract execution and randomness generation.

## How It Works

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Encrypt & Submit**

A user encrypts a transaction, specifying **conditions for decryption**. The encrypted transaction is then sent to the network. Multiple transactions can be encrypted under the same conditions and decrypted in batches.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Decryption Triggered**

When the decryption condition is met, validators **collaborate to generate a threshold decryption key**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution on the Destination Chain**

The decryption key is sent to the destination blockchain, where it unlocks the encrypted transactions. Once decrypted, transactions are executed on the network.
