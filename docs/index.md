# Freedom to transact
![X1 blockchain banner](public/img/x1-banner%20(1).png)

X1 is a high-performance, high-throughput, monolithic L1 blockchain built for decentralization and censorship resistance. It maximizes scalability with minimal technical and economic barriers.

## Why X1?

- **Zero-cost voting** – Validators don’t pay for votes, slashing participation costs to just **$5/day**.
- **Multiple revenue streams** – Earn rewards through voting, delegator commissions, block rewards, and bootstrap incentives. [Set up your validator now](operating-a-validator/).
- **Fair transaction pricing** – Uses congestion-based dynamic base fees, similar to Ethereum’s EIP-1559, preventing spam and underpricing.
- **SVM compatibility** – Seamless deployment for Solana-based applications. [Start building](developing-programs/create-a-program).

## Live on X1 Testnet
With hundreds of validators already participating, X1 is battle-tested ahead of mainnet. [Track performance here](http://x1val.online/).
