# Bootstrap bonus program

To support the growth of the network's infrastructure, validators receive additional incentives through a bootstrap program. A total of 10 million XN, or alternatively 55,000 XN per epoch, is allocated to validators on the X1 blockchain. Eligibility for the bootstrap bonus requires meeting specific criteria (XYZ). The distribution of the bootstrap bonus for each epoch is determined by a validator's score, which is based on a credit system.
